# StatPro

StatPro is an Android application that showcases a collection of sports analysis tools. The project contains a simple example `MainActivity` listing all available analyses and alerts. Each feature is displayed on screen for demonstration purposes.

This repository provides a minimal Android Gradle setup and is not intended for production use. You can import it into Android Studio to explore the structure and extend the implementation.
